Afloat
------

Afloat, originally started by [@millenomi][], adds useful window management
commands to _most_ Mac apps, such as "Keep on top" and "Focus Follows Mouse",
that you may be accustomed to if you ever used a _real_ UNIX window manager.

Afloat adds the following options to supported apps' _Window_ menu and if no _Window_ menu exists it will add it's own Afloat menu:

Installation
------------

Download and install mySIMBL from [@w0lfschild][]'s [repository][simbl-repo],
then download [the current release][current-binary], unpack it, and drag the
extracted `Afloat.bundle` file onto the mySIMBL window. That's it!

Caveats
-------

As of OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) _System Integrity Protection_ must be _disabled_ in order to install SIMBL. _System Integrity Protection_ can be re-enabled once SIMBL has been installed.
